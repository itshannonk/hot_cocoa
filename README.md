We're making a text-based game about artificial intelligence
taking over the world.

General layout:
Every major decision in the game is going to lead the user to
a new webpage. This is for the sake of organization and
simplicity. Each of those webpage will have handlers in the
main.py file.

main.py:
To stay organized, we have made a central python page (main.py)
and 4 others. The 4 other webpages contain the functions the
functions that make the part of the game work (decisions made
by the user).
